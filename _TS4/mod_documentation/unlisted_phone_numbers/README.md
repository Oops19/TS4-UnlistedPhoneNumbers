# TS4 Unlisted Phone Numbers
Clone of one abandoned mod created by scumbumbo.

The .package file has been copied with these changes:
1. An additional filter has been added.
2. Some translations have been added.

The script files have been fixed for the current TS4 version.
Redundant code has been removed and S4CL is used instead for injections.

The interaction can be found in `Friendly > Exchange Numbers`. 
It's not in Small Talk or any other sub category so you can't miss it. 
In future it might be moved into 'Small Talk'.

## Testing
I tested this mod technically.
It might still fail to work as expected while it writes a log file now.

## Overrides
'Drama Nodes' which contain one of these strings will not be affected:
* Intro
* MusicProductionStation
* clubGatheringDramaNode_Default
* Quirk_PublicNumber

They are hard-coded right now while it would make a lot of sense to add them to a config file.
Not sure if one would like to add there also
* ActorCareer
* HighSchool

# Addendum

## Game compatibility
This mod has been tested with `The Sims 4` 1.108.349, S4CL 3.7, TS4Lib 0.3.24 (2024-07-25).
It is expected to be compatible with many upcoming releases of TS4, S4CL and TS4Lib.

## Dependencies
Download the ZIP file, not the sources.

All are available for free.

## Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.

## Usage Tracking / Privacy
This mod does not send any data to tracking servers. The code is open source, not obfuscated, and can be reviewed.

Some log entries in the log file ('mod_logs' folder) may contain the local username, especially if files are not found (WARN, ERROR).
